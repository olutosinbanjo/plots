## Plotting A Direction Field with Python

The construction of a Direction Field (DF) is usually the first step in exploring a Differential Equation (DE). 
The construction of a DF of a DE does not require that we solve the DE first. We only just have to repeatedly evaluate the given function over a grid of points, 
which are numerical intervals. Furthermore, DF’s can be constructed for even the most challenging DE’s.
Finally, you need a computer and a suitable application software to repeatedly evaluate a given function over some numerical interval.

##  2.1  How to construct a DF
1. Draw a rectangular grid of a few hundred points;
2. Evaluate the given function, (DE), at each point: At each point draw a short line segment whose slope is equal to the value of the function at that point. 
Each line segment drawn is the tangent to the graph of the solution passing through that point.
